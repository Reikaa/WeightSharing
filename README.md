# WeightSharing
Autodifferentiation with weight sharing

+ Extension to my previouse auto differentiation attempts [!https://github.com/dkohlsdorf/AutoDiff/blob/master/Readme.md]
+ Implements functionality to allow multiple incoming gradients (as needed by weight sharing).


#Installation:
+ install scala
+ install sbt

#Usage:
In the project directory
+ ./sbt
+ run experiments.MNISMultiLayer
+ run experiments.SpiralMultiLayer
+ run experiments.Trigonometric
+ run experiments.VariationalAutoEncoder
